W zależności czy mamy vulnerable system mamy VC VI VA a jak mamy subsequent to SC SI SA I będziemy je tak samo przeliczać
VA based on Availability (values stay the same)
VC based on Confidentiality (values stay the same)
VI based on Integrity (values stay the same)
UI if N leave N, else change R to P since P is more malicious attack(or A based on Attack Vector(?))
