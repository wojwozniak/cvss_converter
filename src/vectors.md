# CVE-2020-1147
## CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
### Base score v3.1.
7.8
### Threat metrics:
- Exploit Maturity (EM) - Proof-of-Concept (P); P-o-c code is avaiable, but there are no reported attacks.
### Environmental Metrics:
This vulnerability allows for the attacker to execute code with the same rights as the user that was the victim of the attack. Based on this fact if the attacker targets the right users any loss of Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability could be catasrophic.
- Confidentiality Requirements (CR) - High (H).
- Integrity Requirements (IR) - High (H).
- Availability Requirements (AR) - High (H).
### Supplemental Metrics:
- Safety (S) - Present (P); as seen in before mentioned metrics the consequences do not fit the definition of negligible and are definitelly of a higher caliber.
- Automatable (AU) - Yes (Y); an attacker could make a script that would place the exploitative XML file on a server and they could automate it for different users in that server or different servers.
- Provider Urgency (U) - Amber; based on the exploitability assessment provided by Microsoft.
- Recovery (R) - Not Defined (X)*.
- Value Density (V) - Concentrated (C); in the case of attacks on users with apt rights.
- Vulnerability Response Effort (RE) - Not Defined (X)*.
*Based on the available information I can not define those metrics. There were no recorded attacks so there is no information on recovery and response to exploitation of this vulnerability.

# CVE-2020-1472
## CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
### Base score v3.1.
5.5 -> 10.0
### Threat metrics:
- Exploit Maturity (EM) - Proof-of-Concept (P); P-o-c code is avaiable, but there are no reported attacks.
### Environmental Metrics:
Allows for attackers to bypass security constraints (gain the credentials of the admin) remotely. The structure of the domain does not matter as the exploit of this vulnerability bypasses security no matter what.
- Confidentiality Requirements (CR) - Low (L).
- Integrity Requirements (IR) - Low (L).
- Availability Requirements (AR) - Low (L).
### Supplemental Metrics:
- Safety (S) - Present (P); the attacker can do anything on the domain.
- Automatable (AU) - Yes (Y); the exploitative code cann be run remotely to access any domain.
- Provider Urgency (U) - Not Defined (X); the Samba security team was unaware of his vulnerability before Microsoft published an announcement including a patch that fixed it.
- Recovery (R) - Not Defined (X)*.
- Value Density (V) - Concentrated (C); the attacker gains access to the whole domain.
- Vulnerability Response Effort (RE) - Not Defined (X)*.
*Based on the available information I can not define those metrics. There were no recorded attacks so there is no information on recovery and response to exploitation of this vulnerability.
